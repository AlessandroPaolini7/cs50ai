# CS50AI Repository

Welcome to my CS50AI repository! This repository contains all the projects and assignments completed as part of the CS50AI course.

## About CS50AI

CS50AI is a course offered by Harvard University that introduces students to the exciting field of Artificial Intelligence. Throughout this course, students learn various AI concepts, algorithms, and techniques, using Python and other tools. The projects in this repository showcase the implementation and application of different AI techniques, providing a hands-on learning experience.

## Projects

### Project 0: Degrees

**Description:** In this project, I implemented a program that determines the degree of separation between two actors by finding the shortest path between them in a movie database.

**Files:**
- `degrees.py`
- `small`

### Project 0b: Tic Tac Toe

**Description:** In this project, I implemented a Tic Tac Toe game using Python and utilized the Minimax algorithm to create an AI player that plays optimally. To try it, please make sure to run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the directory of the project to install the required Python package (pygame). After that, you should be able to run `python runner.py` to play against the AI.

**Files:**
- `tictactoe.py`
- `runner.py`
- `requirements.txt`

### Project 1a: Knights and Knaves

**Description:** In this project, I implemented a program to solve logic puzzles involving Knights and Knaves. Knights always tell the truth, while Knaves always lie. The goal is to determine who is a Knight and who is a Knave based on the statements provided by characters in the puzzle.

**Files:**
- `logic.py`
- `puzzle.py`

### Project 1b: Minesweeper

**Description:** In this project, I implemented a Minesweeper game. Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the player must uncover hidden mines on a grid while avoiding triggering them. The game incorporates AI techniques to provide hints and improve gameplay.

**Files:**
- `minesweeper.py`
- `runner.py`
- `requirements.txt`

### Project 2a: PageRank

**Description:** In this project, I implemented the PageRank algorithm, which is used to rank web pages based on their importance. It involves both a sampling method and an iterative method to estimate PageRank values.

**Files:**
- `pagerank.py`

### Project 2b: Heredity

**Description:** In this project, I implemented a program to predict the probability of a trait being passed on from parents to offspring based on genetic data. The project involves calculating conditional probabilities using the Bayesian network model.

**Files:**
- `heredity.py`
